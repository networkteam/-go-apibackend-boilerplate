# Go API backend boilerplate

This is a boilerplate for creating a GraphQL API backend with go.
It contains the setup for a monorepo application and is meant to be used as a starting point for creating a new project.
Because every project is different, all files can be freely changed to reflect the actual needs of the project.
E.g. it might use organisations for a multi-tenant application and authentication needs might differ.
That's why a boilerplate can be better shaped and has fewer abstractions than using a modular framework.

See [./docs](docs) for more information.
